00:00:20.500  --> 00:00:23.500
we use in our foodeveryday can also 
have very real health benefits.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.600
A new study from the Rush
University Medical Center finds that


8
00:00:27.000 -->  00:00:30.000
cinnamon can actually reverse the
anatomical changes that occur


9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the brains of mice with 
Parkinson's disease.


10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.000
cinnamon has long been known to be great
for your health 

11
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.320
it's loaded with antioxidants and 
it's 

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.020
especially helpful for people with type 
2 diabetes 

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.550
a 2010 study found that consuming two grams of
cinnamon every day for 12 weeks

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
significantly lowered patient's blood
pressure and blood sugar levels in

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
another study from that same year found
that cinnamon extract can actually

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
increase insulin sensitivity and improve

17
00:00:56.000
hyperglycemia in mice I love cinnamon so
0:58
this is great news for me but it also
0:59
got me thinking about other spices and
1:01
what kinds of benefits those have so I
1:03
thought I would do a little roundup for
1:05
you guys of the most healthful spices
1:06
out there and why each of them is so
1:08
good for you
1:09
turmeric for example which is found in a
1:10
lot of Indian food may actually help
1:12
fight cancer it contains an antioxidant
1:14
called curcumin that's been shown to
1:17
enhance the effectiveness of chemo in
1:19
patients with breast cancer so much in
1:21
fact that it's now being considered as a
1:23
possible drug supplement for
1:24
chemotherapy it's also been shown to
1:26
suppress the specific cell pathway
1:28
that's known to fuel the growth of head
1:30
and neck cancer if you're not a fan of
1:31
Indian food that is okay because
1:33
rosemary has also been shown to minimize
1:35
the risk of cancer the 2010 study found
1:37
that rosemary is the number one most
1:39
effective spice when it comes to
1:41
reducing the amount of carcinogenic
1:43
compounds you ingest from cooking ground
1:45
beef it's also known to have significant
1:47
antibacterial properties as well as
1:49
antifungal properties which makes it a
1:51
good home remedy for yeast infections if
1:53
you have a bacterial infection though
1:55
time may actually be the way to go many
1:57
studies have touted thyme oil as an
1:59
effective inhibitor of harmful bacterial
2:01
growth in raw poultry so if you were to
2:04
marinade chicken in essential thyme oil
2:06
you could greatly extend its shelf life
2:08
it's even being considered as a possible
2:10
alternative treatment for antibiotic
2:12
resistant
2:13
like MRSA that plus it's
2:14
anti-inflammatory properties make time
2:17
one of the best home remedies for acne
2:18
and speaking of anti-inflammatories
2:21
ginger is also one of the most effective
2:23
natural ones out there it contains two
2:25
key phytochemicals known to fight
2:27
inflammation which is why you typically
2:28
see it used in teas for people
2:30
congestion or sore throat it's also
2:32
great for arthritis and research
2:34
published in the Journal of pain shows
2:35
that daily supplements containing 2
2:37
grams of ginger can actually ease muscle
2:39
pain from exercising by 25% if pain is a
2:42
common problem for you then you may also
2:44
be interested to know that Chili Peppers
2:45
are great analgesics the active
2:48
component in them is called capsaicin
2:50
and it's been shown over time to reduce
2:51
certain pain causing neurotransmitters
2:54
it's currently used in topical form for
2:56
all kinds of health problems ranging
2:57
from post surgical pain to arthritis
2:59
even things like psoriasis and if that
3:01
is not enough it's also known to cause
3:03
weight loss a 2009 study found that
3:06
capsaicin can actually alter key
3:07
proteins found in fat making it a
3:09
natural and viable method for reducing
3:12
abdominal fat of course these are just a
3:14
small handful of spices that are good
3:15
for your health but there's actually way
3:17
more oregano garlic nutmeg and a bunch
3:20
of others all have their own unique
3:21
health benefits so eat up maybe you can
3:24
stave off cancer probably not but it
3:26
won't hurt right if you're interested in
3:28
cramming your brain with even more
3:29
knowledge then let me remind you guys
3:31
