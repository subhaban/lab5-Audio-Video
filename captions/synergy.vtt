Spices -- They are good for the soul but they are aslo good for our bodies
1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.000
we've got roundup of all the best spices and what makes them so good for your health

2
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:13.999
in a very famous town that you're too stupid to have heard of.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Hey guys,Tara here from Dnews and if you are a person who enjoys cooking or eating then you'll happy to know

4
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.500
that many of spices we use in our food everyday can also have very real health benefits

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a new study from Rush University Medical Center finds that 

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
cinnamon can actually reverse the anatomical changes that occur in 

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:21.500
brain of mice.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to demonstrate how you how we can leverage a synergy.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
First of all, I've got this banana

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
This banana represents "Web 2.0" and look,

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've written on it some "user-generated content"

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
just to prove the point [You Suck, WTF, LOL]

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I take my "Web 2.0" and I put it in an envelope

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
marked "paradigm shift".

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
OK. Very important, I put the envelope down and

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
With a bit of "blue sky thinking"

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
I "push the envelope"

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then, I take my leverage mallet, and

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.000
URGH!

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
RGRRRRRARGRGGH!!

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
EURGGGARRRRGGGRRGARGG!! AHAARRAGGHGRRAGAHAARGH!!!!

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.500
...and there we can see a synergy, leveraged.
